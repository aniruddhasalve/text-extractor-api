# text-extractor-api

## Text extraction REST API

POST /extract turns PDF, DOCX, HTML, or TXT bytes into clean text using stdlib HTML/XML/ZIP adapters and an optional pdftotext binary.

This is a small reusable Python 3.11 service with no runtime dependencies. It uses the standard library HTTP server so it can be copied into internal automation, extended, or deployed behind a reverse proxy.

## Run

```bash
python3 server.py
# listens on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Send JSON requests with `Content-Type: application/json`. Every service exposes `GET /health`. See `tests/test_api.py` for request examples. External binaries are optional and are reported as clear `503`/`501` responses when not configured.

## Test

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
